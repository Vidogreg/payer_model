# payer_model
Classification model that predicts whether a player is going to pay in the future.

The input features will reflect the behaviour of the player in first **_m_** days (**_m_** will be 2, 3 or 7). The output will be 0/1 based on how likely he is to pay (again or for the first time) in next **_n_** days (**_n_** will be 84, 168 or 365).

BUhahahahaa
